# 🎯 Thematic-Analyzer

**Automated Braun & Clarke thematic analysis for batches of interview transcripts – powered by OpenAI.**
You drop your `.txt` or `.md` transcripts in the "/transcripts"-folder (and optionally in one or several sub folders if interviews were held across different contexts, e.g. Kenya v. Zambia), run one command, and get a multi-sheet Excel workbook with:

| Sheet                      | What’s inside                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Themes × Interviews**    | Theme definitions, per-interview codes, and the representative quotes you told the tool to keep (default: ≤3 per cell).               |
| **Custom Analyses**        | One row per “custom question” you register (e.g. _Ticket Sizes & Stage Coverage_). Each interview’s answer appears in its own column. |
| **Summary Stats**          | A 1–3 sentence GPT summary that quantifies patterns across **all** interviews for every custom question.                              |
| **Stats – Kenya / Zambia** | Same as above but split by region.                                                                                                    |

All long-running OpenAI calls come with exponential-backoff retry logic, so you rarely crash even on free-tier rate limits.

**For example output** of complete analysis and custom questions, have a look at the files in the "/output"-folder.

## ⚡ Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/thematic-analyzer.git
cd thematic-analyzer
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."  # or put it in a .env file
```

Put transcripts in the `transcripts/` folder.
If a parent folder contains the word "kenya" (case-insensitive), the file is tagged “|Kenya”; otherwise “|Zambia”.

```
transcripts/
├── kenya/
│   ├── 04_03_25 - VC firm.txt
│   └── 20_02_25 - PE fund.txt
└── zambia/
    ├── 10_02_25 - Accelerator Hub.txt
    └── 11_02_25 - VC Debt Fund.txt
```

### ▶️ Run the full pipeline

```bash
python run.py
# → analysis.xlsx
```

### ▶️ (Optional) Only answer custom questions

```bash
python run_custom_questions.py
# → custom_questions_and_answers.xlsx
```

## 🛠 What the scripts do

| File                      | Purpose                                                                                                                      | Key switches                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `thematic_analyzer.py`    | Library class that orchestrates everything (segmentation → inductive coding → clustering → GPT theme naming → Excel export). | `model`, `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `max_quotes_per_cell`, etc. |
| `run.py`                  | End-to-end thematic analysis. Adds demo questions, runs `ta.run()`, clusters codes, and writes Excel.                        | Edit or add `ta.add_custom_row(...)`, change clustering method.   |
| `run_custom_questions.py` | Skips theme generation and answers only your custom rows.                                                                    | Use when you just want a structured Q\&A sheet.                   |

## 🚀 Sample output

<details>
<summary>Custom Analyses → “Ticket Sizes & Stage Coverage” (excerpt)</summary>

**Interview:**
`04_03_25 – VC firm|Kenya`
**Own fund:** \$3–20M (sweet spot > \$5M), usually Series B.
**Market:** Kenya still needs patient pre-seed/Series A capital.
**Quote:** “Our ticket sizes are between \$3 M and 20 M … we’d be happy to do >\$5 M.”

**Interview:**
`10_02_25 – Accelerator Hub|Zambia`
**Own fund:** Not mentioned.
**Market:** Zambia’s VC ecosystem is tiny; ticket sizes rare >\$500k.
**Quote:** “There’s little to no early-stage capital. A typical Zambian enterprise would be looking for around \$250k.”

</details>

<details>
<summary>Thematic Insights sheet (one row per theme)</summary>

**Theme: Financial Dynamics and Constraints**

🇿🇲 Zambia (7/13) stress the absence of local exits and default to debt; 🇰🇪 Kenya (10/18) more often juggle equity + mezzanine but fear FX swings.
Kukula (ZM) calls local banks “collateral-obsessed”, while Simon (KE) lauds SAFEs but still “gets crushed” by shilling weakness.

## 🧩 How it works (under the hood)

- **Segmentation** – each transcript is split into \~600-character chunks.
- **Inductive coding** – GPT returns ≤3 semantic codes (JSON) per chunk.
- **Clustering** – codes are embedded (OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`) and clustered.
- **Theme naming** – GPT summarizes clusters and quotes to define themes.
- **RQ tagging (optional)** – maps themes to your Research Questions.
- **Representative quotes** – selects top `n` quotes per theme and interview.
- **Custom rows** – analyst-defined prompts answered per transcript.
- **Excel writer** – merges data into Excel and color-codes by RQ.

All GPT/embedding calls include retry logic:

```python
delay = 1
for attempt in range(100):
    try:
        return openai.chat.completions.create(...)
    except openai.error.RateLimitError:
        time.sleep(delay)
        delay *= 1.5
```

## ⏱ Runtime & Rate Limits

| Model                    | Free-tier limit       | Usage @ 30 transcripts | Safe? |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------- | ----- |
| `gpt-4o-mini`            | \~10 req/min, 500/day | \~1 req/min            | ✔     |
| `text-embedding-3-small` | \~250 req/min         | batched (100/req)      | ✔     |

## 📁 FAQ

**Can I switch to a faster model?**
Yes – pass `model="gpt-3.5-turbo"` when creating the ThematicAnalyzer. It’s cheaper, but theme naming quality drops.

**How do I change the number of quotes per theme/interview?**
Set `max_quotes_per_cell=1` in `ta.to_excel(...)`.

**Where are raw GPT conversations saved?**
Use `save_cache="logs/gpt_cache.ndjson"` when running.

**What if a transcript mentions neither Kenya nor Zambia?**
Defaults to “Zambia” (see `load_transcripts_from_dir`).
